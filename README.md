# reddit-clone
my attempt at cloning reddit, where you will be able to post on a forum type thread.
There wil also be login handled by <strong>passport</strong> and all of my templates will be in <strong>Nunjucks</strong>.


## Don't forget to...
```
npm install
```
## Things that I am working on right now
[] Making sure all the routes once logged in don't log you out
[] Getting the final structure of the website(css and njk)
[] Looking into uploading files other than text
[] Add tags to sort out post in a search
[] Fixing up the the older methods that was in old mongo boiler plate to bring them into the now
[] Work on tracking user data and associating it with the post
[] Work on feature to set apart from reddit


# Update!
This Project has been dropped and will be picked up at a later date. Bee on the look out for the Tekken companion app.
